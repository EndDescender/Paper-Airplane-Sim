# Paper Airplane Simualtion

Paper airplanes are light, thin, small aircrafts that travel through air rather efectively.

The purpose of this simulation is to show the results of throwing a plane at sea level 
since a paper plane going above 500 ft is unrealistic. 

# Model:

The model implements drag as a function of velocity, and STP for sea level conditions.
Forces acting on the plane are lift, weight, thrust, and drag.

# Force of lift:

Lift acts upwards on the plane, it is a function of the mach number, angle, and reynolds number of the aircraft
travelting through the atmosphere. This can simplify to coefficient of lift, velocity, and dynamic pressure in the equation:

L = Cl * 1/2 * rho * (Velocity ^ 2) * S             Equation 1

S refers to the surface area of the plane.

The constant for surface area in our calculations is 0.023 from a research paper on the 
aerodynamics of paper planes: http://www.lactea.ufpr.br/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/On_the_Aerodynamics_of_Paper_Airplanes.pdf

rho (the density) assumed the SI value of 1.225 kg/m^3

# Force of drag:

Drag opposes the motion of an object moving through a medium, in this case the medium is air. 

Like lift, drag follows a similar approach to its equation with the only exception being that drag
uses the cross sectional area since drag acts perpendicular to lift. 
The equation then is:

D = Cd * 1/2 * rho * (velocity ^ 2) * C             Equation 2

where C is the cross sectional area
The value for C is 0.008 m^2
This value came from an educated guess as a paper plane is flat, and a small value for its cross-sectional area
should not impeded the realism of the simulation. 


# Force of thrust:

Thrust is what keeps the plane moving forward, and what primarily resists the effect of drag on the plane
However, there is no thrust as the plane has no propulsion systems. 
A technical "thrust" would be the initial velocity given to it.

# Force of weight:

Within Earth's gravity (9.81 m/s^2), weight pulls objects towards the center of the Earth, 
and in this case it is what will ensure that the plane will come back down. 

Weight is calculated in accordance to Newtons Second Law:

F = m * g                                           Equation 3

m is the mass of the aircraft

# Running the simulation:

Due to probems with the build file retianing the specific directory that the simulation was built from,
it is advised to copy everything but the build file from github at https://github.com/EndDescender/Paper-Airplane-Sim
Also please place the PlaneDisplay file in the $HOME directory. 

Then, run ""trick-CP"" in the directory to build the simulation, and ""./S_main_* RUN_test/input.py"" to run the simulation
