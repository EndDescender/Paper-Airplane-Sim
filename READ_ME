# Paper Airplane Simualtion

Paper airplanes are light, thin, small aircrafts that travel through air rather efectively.

The purpose of this simulation is to show the results of throwing a plane at sea level 
since a paper plane going above 500 ft is unrealistic. 

# Model:

The model implements drag as a function of velocity, and STP for sea level conditions.
Forces acting on the plane are lift, weight, thrust, and drag.

# Force of lift:

Lift acts upwards on the plane, it is a function of the mach number, angle, and reynolds number of the aircraft
travelting through the atmosphere. This can simplify to coefficient of lift, velocity, and dynamic pressure in the equation:

L = Cl * 1/2 * rho * (Velocity ^ 2) * S             Equation 1

S refers to the surface area of the plane. 


# Force of drag:




# Running the simulation:

Due to probems with the build file retianing the specific directory that the simulation was built from,
it is advised to copy everything but the build file from github at https://github.com/EndDescender/Paper-Airplane-Sim
Also please place the PlaneDisplay file in the $HOME directory. 

Then, run ""trick-CP"" in the directory to build the simulation, and ""./S_main_* RUN_test/input.py"" to run the simulation
